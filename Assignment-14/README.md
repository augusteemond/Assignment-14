1.) I thought I applied the right coding to the library, but when I click my website itself, the style remains somewhat the same. I am not sure where I went wrong in the styling of the webpage itself

2.) I used a local file and viewed it in raw form because it easily readable that way and I think it came out more concise on my web page.

3.) HTML5 is that last major HTML version that is recommended by the W3c. It allows for more creativity and control of a givin webpage and because of the that authors of the webpage have unlimited potential with there web pages

4.)Some Struggles I had this week was having the actual js file represent the webpage, I linked all of my html files to the js files but they did not change much. Other than that I had alot of fun working on this assignment and I think its really cool that we can start adding new elements to the web page every week rather than starting from scratch every week.
