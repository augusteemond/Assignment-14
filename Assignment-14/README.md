1.) I thought I applied the right coding to the library, but when I click my website itself, the style remains somewhat the same. I am not sure where I went wrong in the styling of the webpage itself

2.) I used a local file and viewed it in raw form because it easily readable that way and I think it came out more concise on my web page.

3.) HTML5 is that last major HTML version that is recommended by the W3c. It allows for more creativity and control of a givin webpage and because of the that authors of the webpage have unlimited potential with there web pages
